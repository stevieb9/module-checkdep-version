NAME

    Module::CheckDep::Version - List prereqs that need a version bump for
    an author's distributions

SYNOPSIS

        use Module::CheckDep::Version qw(check_deps);
    
        # list only the author's own prereqs that are behind
    
        check_deps('STEVEB');
        
        # list all prereqs that are behind by all authors
    
        check_deps('STEVEB', all => 1);
    
        # check only a single distribution
    
        check_deps('STEVEB', module => 'RPi::WiringPi');
    
        # return the data within a hash reference instead of printing
    
        check_deps('STEVEB', return => 1);
    
        # send in your own custom function to manage the data
    
        check_deps('STEVEB', handler => \&my_handler);
    
        sub my_handler {
            # this is the actual code from the default
            # handler
    
            my $dists = shift;
            
            for my $dist (keys %$dists){
                print "$dist:\n";
                for my $dep (keys %{ $dists->{$dist} }){
                    print "\t$_:\n" .
                          "\t\t$dists->{$dist}{$dep}{dep_ver} -> " .
                          "$dists->{$dist}{$dep}{cur_ver}\n";
                }
                print "\n";
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION

    This module retrieves all [http://cpan.org|CPAN] distributions for a
    single author, extracts out all of the dependencies for each
    distribution, then lists all dependencies that have updated versions so
    you're aware which prerequisite distributions are behind in version
    than what is currently being required.

    Can list only the prerequisites that are written by the same author, or
    optionally all prerequisite distributions by all authors.

EXPORT_OK

    We export only a single function upon request: check_deps().

FUNCTIONS

 check_deps($author, [%args])

    Fetches a list of a CPAN author's distributions using MetaCPAN::Client,
    extracts out the list of each distribution's prerequisite
    distributions, compares the required version listed against the
    currently available version and either returns or prints to the screen
    a list of each dependency that requires a version bump.

    Parameters:

        $author

    Mandatory, String: A valid CPAN author's user name.

        module => 'Some::Module'

    Optional, String. The name of a valid CPAN distribution by the author
    specified. We'll only look up the results for this single distribution
    if this param is sent in.

        all => 1

    Optional, Bool. By default, we'll only list prerequisites by the same
    $author. Setting this to true will list prereq version bumps required
    for all listed prerequisite distributions. Defaults to off/false.

        return => 1

    Optional, Bool. By default we print results to STDOUT. Set this to true
    to have the data in hash reference form returned to you instead.
    Default is off/false.

        handler => \&function

    Optional, code reference. You can send in a reference to a function you
    create to handle the data. See "SYNOPSIS" for an example of the format
    of the single hash reference we pass into your function.
